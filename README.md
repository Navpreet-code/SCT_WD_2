## 📋 Task Objective (Given by SkillCraft)

> 🔹 Create a Calculator Web App with:
> * Core arithmetic functionality (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
> * Clear & Delete functionality
> * User-friendly layout
> * Optional: Scientific operations (sin, cos, log, π, etc.)
> * Responsive Design
> * Deploy on GitHub Pages

## ✨ My Approach & Enhancements (Extra Effort)

> I went beyond basic requirements to deliver a fully polished calculator application:
✅ Fully responsive design using CSS Flex & Grid
✅ Built a clean and modern UI using Bootstrap + Google Fonts
✅ Added glowing calculator title and hover effects
✅ Standard arithmetic functions with error handling
✅ Scientific panel including: sin, cos, tan, √, log, ln, π, e, ^ and smart brackets
✅ Smooth right-side expand/collapse animation for scientific panel
✅ Mode toggle button to slide in/out scientific panel
✅ Mobile-first responsiveness with scroll-optimized layout
✅ Touch feedback animation for better mobile experience
✅ Deployed to GitHub Pages with clean UI

🛠 This project reflects my initiative to not only complete the task but deliver a real-world project with advanced UI/UX.
